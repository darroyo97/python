print("test" == 1)
print(not (True and False))
print(not (1 == 1 and 0 != 1))
print(not (10 == 1 or 1000 == 1000))
print(not (1 != 10 or 3 == 4))
print(not ("testing" == "testing" and "Zed" == "Cool Guy"))
print(1 == 1 and (not ("testing" == 1 or 1 == 0)))
print("chunky" == "bacon" and (not (3 == 4 or 3 == 3)))
