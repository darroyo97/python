# The Python type for storing true and false values is called bool.
# Boolean values are the two constants False and True.
# They are used in comparisons to represent truth values.
# In numeric contexts(for example, when used as the argument to an arithmetic operator),
# they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively.
