# 3 main problems with structured programming

# 1. emphasis on functionality not data
# 2. Limitations
# 3. Gap in developer client comunication


# Object oriented Programming

#-Objects, classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

# objects - way to represent real life
#attributes = properties
#behavior - functionality

# class- container that defines your object
# example
# class Student:
#   properties(attributes):
# ....
#   functions(behavior)


# Abstactions - limit your attributes and functions to only items that pertain to the program
# encapsulation - limit access to data. only functions and classes that need access can have access.
# controlling access to data
# can only access data through public functions(interface)
# class Student:

# properties(attributes):
# .
# . private properties
# .
# functions(behavior)
# .
# . public functions
# . private functions


# Inheritance
# Child class inherits all of the properties and functions of parent class
# -Reusibility
# -Child class can extend on properties and functions
# -Reusabilty + Extensibility
# Parent

# Object (parent)
# .
# .
# .
# Object(child)
