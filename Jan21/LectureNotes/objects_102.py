# 3 main problems with structured programming

# 1. emphasis on functionality not data
# 2. Limitations

# Object oriented Programming

#-Objects, classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

# objects - way to represent real life
#attributes = properties
#behavior - functionality

# class- container that defines your object
# example
# class Student:
#   properties(attributes):
# ....
#   functions(behavior)
